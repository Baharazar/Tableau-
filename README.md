## Airbnb Data Analysis Project using Tableau

### Overview

This project marks my first experience with Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool that enables data analysts to work with live datasets and focus on generating insights rather than getting bogged down in data wrangling. The user-friendly interface of Tableau, which doesn't require programming or advanced technical skills, inspired me to learn and apply it for my data analysis projects.

### Project Motivation

In recent years, many homeowners have started considering renting their properties on a short-term basis via platforms like Airbnb. To help these potential hosts make data-driven decisions—such as identifying the best times to list their properties or determining competitive pricing—effective data analysis is crucial. This project aims to provide insights that can guide property owners in optimizing their rental strategies. I chose Tableau for this task because it offers an intuitive way to create comprehensive reports that are easy for clients to understand.

### Dataset

The project utilizes the **Seattle Airbnb Open Data** of 2016. This dataset comprises three CSV files:

- **Calendar**: Contains data on dates and availability.
- **Listings**: Provides detailed information on the properties available for rent, including location details like address, neighborhood, city, state, and zip code.
- **Reviews**: Includes both listing IDs and review IDs, which are essential to differentiate.

### Key Visualizations and Insights

1. **Price by Zip Code**: This visualization highlights the average price per zip code, helping investors and property owners determine the most profitable locations for Airbnb rentals or gauge rental rates in their vicinity.

2. **Map Visualization**: Using zip codes for location data ensures consistency and provides a clear geographical overview of available properties, enhancing the overall data analysis.

3. **Revenue by Year**: This analysis identifies seasonal trends, showing when properties are most likely to generate higher revenue. For example, lower revenues are observed from January to February, likely due to post-holiday slowdowns, whereas the end of the year and summer holidays tend to see more bookings.

4. **Price per Bedroom**: This visualization compares the average rental prices based on the number of bedrooms. It helps identify which property types are more in demand and can be used to target potential clients. The data shows that 5- and 6-bedroom properties are particularly popular and yield higher revenue, suggesting that investing in such properties could be advantageous.

5. **Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings**: This visualization analyzes the competition for specific property types, revealing that properties with more rooms face less competition, making them potentially more profitable.

### Conclusion

By leveraging Tableau, this project provides meaningful insights into the Seattle Airbnb market. The visualizations created in this project can help property owners and investors make data-driven decisions to maximize their rental income. Tableau proved to be an invaluable tool for presenting these findings in a clear, accessible way.
